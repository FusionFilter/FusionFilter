## FusionFilter Release v0.1.0 (Mar 5, 2016)

separates homology filter from promiscuity filter, and homology filter is followed by promiscuity filter.

Also, filtering based on promiscuity takes into account the abundance of evidence so that well-supported fusions are not discarded due to the finding of lowly supported promiscuous entries.
